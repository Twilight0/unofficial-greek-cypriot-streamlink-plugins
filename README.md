## Unofficial streamlink plugins

*(Mainly for greek and cypriot tv channels)*

Not particularly sophisticated, but they definitely do the job

They are mainly used by AliveGR Kodi addon, but you can benefit from them by using them purely via cli command.

Or here via an option:

But you can use `.streamlinkrc` as well
